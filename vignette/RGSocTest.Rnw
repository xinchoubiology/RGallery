\subsection{Data simulation setup for L2}
Given that test 1 need us provide different data set of different size to record how much time \textbf{glmnet} takes for different data size. 

I generate Gaussian data with $N$ observation and $p$ predictors. with each pair of predictors $X_j, X_{j'}$ has the same population correlation $\rho$. If $N$ and $\rho$ are determined. We generate the observed data $Y$ by adding several gaussian noise.

\begin{equation}
  Y = \sum_{j=1}^pX_j\beta_j + kZ
\end{equation}

If $Y$ is a $N \times 1$ column vector, then $X_j, X_{j'}$ are all $N \times 1$ column vectors, so $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N \times p$ matrix and $\beta$ is a $p \times 1$ column vector.

$Z$ represents noise of observation, and $k$ is chosen so that we can control signal-to-noise ratio to 3.0.

In generation model, we also should simulate the coefficient vector $\beta$, we define that 

\begin{equation}
  \beta_j = (-1)^j\exp{(\frac{-2(j-1)}{20})}
\end{equation}

This guarantee that the coefficients are constructed to have alternating signs and to be exponential descreasing.

And in logistical regression model, what we observation is $\mathcal{G}=\{1,2\}$, therefore, the logistic regression model represents the probability we observed $\{1,2\}$.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    Pr(G=1|x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0x_0 + ... + \beta_px_p)}} \\
    Pr(G=2|x) = \frac{e^{-(\beta_0x_0 + ... + \beta_px_p)}}{1+e^{-(\beta_0x_0 + ... + \beta_px_p)}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

So we can get the column $\log{(\frac{Pr(G=1|X)}{Pr(G=2|X)})} = \sum_{j=1}^p x_j\beta_j$. In this model, if $Pr(G=1|x) > Pr(G=2|x)$, then response is actual 1, otherwise responese is 2.

However, in real observation, noise will be introduced into this regression model. As the result, we should add an $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ into the original LR model. 

So, the response $Y$ we generate comes from Eqn.(4)

\begin{equation}
  y = \sum_{j=1}^p X_j\beta_j + kZ
\end{equation}

And we also can tell that $y \rightarrow \beta_0x_0 + ... + \beta_px_p$, therefore, we can determine $Pr(G=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 +e^{-y}}$. And then we will define our observation $Y$ by binomial model which generate $Y$ with $Pr(Y=1)=p$ and $Pr(Y=2)=1-p$.

\section{Build a package for data set generation and time record}
Since \textbf{Q2} require us develop a package. Therefore, I develop a simple package for LR2's data simulation. And record all of the time on different data set.

And then, to record glmnet time of different data set size, therefore I create a package \href{https://github.com/xinchoubiology/RGallery}{RGallery} to solve this question. 

To solve \textbf{Q1}, if we fixed feature dimension to 300. then we execute \textbf{glmnet()} on different $N$ size data set. And we let $N \in [100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 100000]$, in addition, I fixed $p = 300$.

<<glmnet-time, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE>>=
require(RGallery)
N <- c(100, 500, 700, 1000, 1500, 2000)
glmnet_time <- sapply(N, function(n){
                          Gbenchmark(sim_dat_LR, N = n, p = 300)
                         }
                      )
colnames(glmnet_time) <- N
@

<<smallsize-t, echo=FALSE>>=
kable(data.frame(t(glmnet_time)), align = "c", col.names = c("user_time/sec", "sys_time/sec", "elapesd/sec"),booktabs=TRUE)
@

\bigskip

Even though that glmnet analysis time changed slightly with data set size increasing, function \text{mvrnorm()} has become too slow when data size was up to $2000 \times 300$. 

As the result, I should rewrite our \textbf{mvrnorm} by a C++ function, so that the time consuming in data simulation can be compressed.
